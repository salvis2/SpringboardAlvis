Repo for my work in the Springboard Data Science Career Track

The two main parts of this repository are my first and second capstone projects.

Capstone Project 1 is called the League of Legends Item Balancing Analysis. It involves API data wrangling, two-sample z-tests, random forests, logistic regression, and, of course, the game League of Legends.

Capstone Project 2 is called the Public Opinion Analysis for Bungie. It involves API data wrangling, NLP, kNN, and random forests on Twitter data.

The mini_projects folder houses notebooks for individual mini-projects I have done during the SpringBoard curriculum.
