## League of Legends Item Balancing
This is the repository for my first capstone project: League of Legends Item Balancing, part of my SpringBoard Data Science Career Track curriculum.

### About this repository
This repository contains the data files and the Jupyter notebooks for each of the steps in my project's analysis.

The process for this capstone project is as follows:
Data is acquired and exported to csv in the data wrangling

Data is visualized and explained in the data storytelling

### Running the Notebooks

If you wish to run the first notebook, you will first need to go to https://developer.riotgames.com/ and get a development API key. You log in with your League of Legends account, if you have one. If not, you need to create one. There is a spot in the data wrangling notebook where you can place the API key, and then the notebook should function correctly.

If you just want to take the data files as they are, you can skip the first notebook and go to the data storytelling.

Running the notebooks in order (wrangling, storytelling, EDA, IDA) should generate all of the data files you see in this repository. It will also generate the various figures that you can find in the presentation.
